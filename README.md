# Lung Cancer Prediction Project

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting lung cancer using Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms. It also implements the Apriori algorithm to recommend doctors based on patient data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance cancer diagnosis and provide personalized medical recommendations by predicting the likelihood of lung cancer based on patient attributes.

## Features

- **Lung Cancer Prediction**: Using Decision Tree and KNN algorithms to classify the presence of lung cancer.
- **Doctor Recommendation System**: Implementation of the Apriori algorithm to identify suitable doctors based on patterns in patient data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques such as normalization, encoding, and feature selection to prepare the dataset for training.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various patient attributes like age, gender, smoking habits, medical history, and symptoms relevant to lung cancer diagnosis.
